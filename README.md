# hello-world
My first repository

Hello people,
First time trying github and learning all i can, to contribute to opensource with little that i know about python.

MY first successful code is about PygLatin. Its a simple text conversion code which shifts the initial letter to the end and adds a suffix,
'ay' in this case.
